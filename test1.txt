For most modern version control systems, such as Subversion, Git or Mercurial, commits are atomic.
This means that changes in multiple files are submitted to the repository as a single unit, 
and the source code on the repository is guaranteed to be in a stable state at all times. However, some teams still use an approach where one logical change set is delivered in several commit operations. In this case, you can use the Quiet Period field to ensure that the build always uses a stable source code version. The Quiet Period value specified here is in fact the default system-wide value?if required, you can redefine this value individually for each project. You also manage user accounts and user rights here. By default, Jenkins lets any user do anything. If you want a more restrictive approach, you will need to activate Jenkins security here using the Enable Security field. There are many ways to do this, and we look at this aspect of Jenkins later on (see Chapter 7).
